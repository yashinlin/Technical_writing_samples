### Technical writing samples

1) **Angola Health For All Performance Evaluation**, 2019. This report was written by a team of consultants that I led. I collected the data and wrote the sections for HIV/AIDS and family planning. Due to the typically short timeframe budgeted for USAID performance evaluations, they tend to make heavy use of triangulation of qualitative data, while making use of available quantitative data where available.  

2) **Aflateen Impact Evaluation Baseline Report**, 2013. USAID impact evaluations use experimental or quasi-experimental designs. This evaluation employed a pretest-posttest control group design.

3) **Assessment of HIV Quality of Care in Cote dâ€™Ivoire**, 2009. This was a assessment of the quality of HIV care in Cote d'Ivoire, using data abstracted from health facility registers. 
   
5) **Using Quality Assessment to Improve Material Care in Nicaragua**, 2003. This case study tells the story of how the Ministry of Health of Nicaragua worked with the QA Project team to assessed the quality of care of public health facilities in four municipalities. The results were used by facility-based quality improvement teams to improve their processes (ie. process improvement). Early in my career I produced over 40 case studies documenting quality improvement/process improvement efforts in low income countries, which boosted my interest in using data to guide decision making.
