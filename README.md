### Technical writing samples

1) **Angola Health For All Performance Evaluation**, 2019. I led a team of consultants to evaluate this Angolan health project, and I also evaluated the HIV/AIDS and family planning parts of the project. Due to the typically short timeframe budgeted for USAID performance evaluations, they tend to make heavy use of triangulation of qualitative data,  incorporating quantitative data where available.  

2) **Aflateen Impact Evaluation Baseline Report**, 2013. This is a baseline study for an impact evaluation that I designed for Mercy Corps/Tajikistan. USAID impact evaluations use experimental or quasi-experimental designs, and this evaluation employed a pretest-posttest control group design.

3) **Assessment of HIV Quality of Care in Cote dâ€™Ivoire**, 2009. This was an assessment of the quality of HIV care in Cote d'Ivoire against WHO standards of care. Data were abstracted from health facility registers. 
   
4) **Using Quality Assessment to Improve Maternal Care in Nicaragua**, 2003. This case study describes how healthcare providers in Nicaragua worked together to improve the quality of obstetric care at their health centers and posts. They began by measuring
the extent to which staff performed according to standards. Once aware of the quality gaps, they formed QI teams and used rapid team problem solving to implement quality improvements so that healthcare providers could perform according to obstetric standards. Continuous monitoring shows their success in meeting the standards and improving health outcomes. 

5) **Assessing the Quality of Facility-Level Family Planning Services in Malawi**, 2000. This case study describes how local staff in Malawi collected, analyzed and interpreted quality assessment data to identify opportunities to improve family planning services.
